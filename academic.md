### Bio

I am a former post-doc researcher in the Networked Systems Lab and part-time faculty in [College of Computer and Information Science](http://ccis.northeaastern.edu) at [Northeastern University](http://www.northeastern.edu) working with [Prof. Guevara Noubir](http://ccis.northeastern.edu/home/noubir). I have received my Ph.D. in computer science from Northeastern University in December 2012. Before my studies at Northeastern I received my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering from [Sharif University of Technology](http://en.sharif.edu) in 2006.

### Research
My research interests include:
 - Wireless communications in extreme conditions
 - Wireless energy transfer, RF Energy harvesting, Ultra-energy-efficient wireless systems
 - Wireless interface for biological system, Nano-scale communication, Synthetic biology
 - Cooperative wireless networks, Wireless sensor networks, Embedded systems

More details can be found in my [**CV**](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/hooman/docs/Hooman-CV.pdf).

### Service

In Spring 2014, I instructed [CS1800 (Discrete Structures)](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs1800/14S) and [CS1100 (Computer Science and its Applications)](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/course/cs1100sp14).

We have organized two NSF workshops in 2011 and 2012:
  - [NSF Workshop on Biologically-Enabled Wireless Networks Design and Modeling](http://madrid.ccs.neu.edu/nsfbw11/)
  - [BioCom²: NSF Workshop on Biological Computations and Communications](http://madrid.ccs.neu.edu/biocom2/)
